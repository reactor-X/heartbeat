/*

You can keep your services here. Universe can include services common to entire app or multiple routes/problem domains.
Services unique to a specific route or module can go into separate directories.

You can bootstrap these services using configuration or directly include them into routes. However, first approach will give more control.
e.g Universe->Authentication->* Universe->Session->* etc.
